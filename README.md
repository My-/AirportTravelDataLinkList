#### All program are writen with few rules in mind.

    "Code readability over comments" - Agile
    "Pay Per Line style is ugly" - MSh
    "Flexability pays off" - MSh & Agile

 I tryed to write program in more "Java8-ish" way but some stuf can't be done in C or can't be done in nice readable way.
 <br>
 ###### I'm managed:
 - create class like structures.
 - pass functions as parameters.
 ###### Failed on:
 - chain functions (would be to ugly).
 - function composition (not suported by C).

##### Folders:
- `admin` - Admin login related funtions.
- `data` - Data "class" and related functions. As well data comparators (used to sort data).
- `node` - Node "class".
- `list` - List "class".
- `db` - DataBase "class".
- `filter` - Unused code. Replaced with Data comparator. Left for references.
